To call it manually in a terminal window, use the following command:
- `curl -sSL https://jamf.it/get-logs | sudo bash`

export CustomApp2LogSource="$7"
export CustomApp3Name="$8"
export CustomApp3LogSource="$9"

curl -sSL jamf.it/get-logs-custom | bash
```

-If you do not see your app folder, it is because the file was not found and the cleanup array removed the empty folder. You can confirm checking the cleanup section of results.html
